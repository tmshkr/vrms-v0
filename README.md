## Getting Started

Once you've [forked](https://github.com/tmshkr/vrms/fork) the repository,
clone it to your local machine with the `--recurse-submodules` option and
install the dependencies with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vrms.git --recurse-submodules
cd vrms && npm run install:dev
```

### Create your `.env` file

To create your `.env` file, copy it from `.env.example`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### Provision your databases

You'll need a Postgres database, so you can either run one locally
or use a service like [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

Provide your connection string starting with `postgres://` as the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env`.

You'll also need a MongoDB instance for task scheduling with [Agenda](https://github.com/agenda/agenda)
and other document data storage.

[MongoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) or a local MongoDB server
can be used to provide your `MONGO_URI` connection string.

### Next.js setup

Next.js will look for the `.env` file in its [own folder](./next), so you can use a symlink to
avoid having two separate `.env` files.

On a Mac, you can create a symlink by running the following command from root directory of the repo:

```
ln -s ../.env next/.env
```

Slack requires the sign-in redirect URL to be served over HTTPS,
so you can generate your own self-signed certificate with the following command:

```
mkdir next/certificates && cd next/certificates
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

You can follow the directions in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@greg.farrow1/nextjs-https-for-a-local-dev-server-98bb441eabd7) to trust the certificate on your local machine.

### Create a Slack app

Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App**.

In the **Create an app** modal that appears, select **From an app manifest**.

Select the workspace you want to develop your app in, and then provide the [app manifest](./slackbot/app-manifest.yaml).

> Be sure to replace `YOUR-NAME` with your name so that we can tell who the app belongs to.

Review the summary and click **Create**.

### Slack app setup

On the **Basic Information** page for your app, click **Install to Workspace**.

Under the **App Credentials** heading, you can get the following environment variables:

- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`

Under the **App-Level Tokens** heading, you'll need to create a token to run in [socket mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket). Click **Generate Token and Scopes** then give the token any name, and make sure to give it the `connections:write` scope.

Copy and paste the token starting with `xapp` as the `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in your `.env`.

To get the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, click **OAuth & Permissions** from the sidebar under the **Features** heading.
On that page, you'll find the **Bot User OAuth Token** starting with `xoxb`.

### Migrate and seed the database

Before you can use the database, you'll need to generate the Prisma client, push the schema to your database, and seed the database with users from Slack:

```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
```

As you make changes to the database, you can see the live data using [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio):

```
npx prisma studio
```

### Start the dev server

Start the dev server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to use the app in your workspace.

Find it in the **Apps** sidebar and go to the Home tab to see your app's homepage.
